The model definitions and associations are generally high-quality, well-structured, and demonstrate a good understanding of Sequelize best practices. The use of UUIDs, detailed validations, and explicit table names is commendable. However, I found a few minor issues related to data integrity and validation logic that could lead to edge-case problems:

1.  **WorkoutPlanExercise `order` Index Uniqueness**: The `WorkoutPlanExercise` model has an index defined as `unique: false` on `['workout_plan_id', 'order']`. The inline comment states, 'Exercises in a plan should have unique order'. If the intention is to strictly enforce that each exercise within a given workout plan must have a distinct order number, then this index should be set to `unique: true`. If multiple exercises can share the same order (e.g., for representing supersets in a specific manner), then the current `unique: false` is correct, but the comment should be adjusted for clarity.

2.  **CompletedExercise `exercise_id` Uniqueness**: The `CompletedExercise` model also defines an index `unique: false` on `['completed_workout_id', 'exercise_id']`. This means that a user could log the same exercise multiple times within a single `CompletedWorkout` entry. While this might be an intentional design choice (e.g., to record separate sets of the same exercise), it's more common to have a single entry per distinct exercise performed in a workout, with details like `setsCompleted` and `repsCompleted` aggregated within that entry. If the intent is that each exercise can appear only once per `CompletedWorkout`, this index should be `unique: true` to prevent redundant entries.

3.  **Date Validation Logic for `isBefore`**: In `User.dateOfBirth`, `CompletedWorkout.date`, and `LoggedFood.date`, the `isBefore` validation uses `new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]` (and `+ 'T23:59:59Z'` for completed/logged dates). This approach has a few potential issues:
    *   **Timezone Dependency**: The comparison is based on the server's current date, which might not align with the user's local date, especially for `DATEONLY` fields. This can cause valid dates (e.g., a user completing a workout today in a different timezone) to be rejected.
    *   **Midnight Edge Cases**: At midnight transitions, discrepancies can occur.
    *   **`DATEONLY` vs. `DATETIME` String**: For `DATEONLY` fields, comparing against a full `DATETIME` string (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DDT23:59:59Z`) can be less predictable than comparing against another `DATEONLY` string or a pure `Date` object.
    
    A more robust validation for `DATEONLY` fields to ensure a date is not in the future would typically involve comparing `YYYY-MM-DD` against the current date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD` in a timezone-aware manner, or using a simpler `isBefore: new Date()` and letting Sequelize's `DATEONLY` type handling resolve it. For instance, using `moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD')` (if Moment.js is available) or a custom validator for precise `DATEONLY` comparisons can provide more predictable results.

These issues are primarily about data integrity and user experience rather than critical security vulnerabilities. The security note about storing hashed passwords is essential, and the model definition correctly uses `STRING` for the password field, awaiting hashing at the application layer.
