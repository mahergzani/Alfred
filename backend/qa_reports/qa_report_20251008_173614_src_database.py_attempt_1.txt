The code is generally well-structured and follows good practices for SQLAlchemy integration, including using environment variables for the database URL, robust connection pooling, and proper session management with `get_db`. The `try...finally` block in `get_db` for session closing is excellent for resource management.

However, there is a significant security vulnerability:

*   **Hardcoded Sensitive Information:** The `DATABASE_URL` variable has a default value (`postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase`) that contains hardcoded, insecure credentials (`user:password`). While the intent is to load from an environment variable, this default fallback is a critical security flaw. If the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is not explicitly set (e.g., during deployment, in a CI/CD pipeline, or even in a misconfigured development environment), the application would attempt to connect using these default, insecure credentials. This can lead to information disclosure, unauthorized database access, and a normalized insecure development practice.

**Recommendation:**
Remove the hardcoded sensitive credentials from the default value. A more secure and robust approach is to either:
1.  Make the default `None` and explicitly raise an error if `DATABASE_URL` is not provided, forcing the developer to configure it:
    ```python
    DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
    if not DATABASE_URL:
        raise ValueError("DATABASE_URL environment variable is not set.")
    ```
2.  If a fallback is absolutely necessary for local development without environment variables, use a connection string that is explicitly *not* for production and does not contain sensitive credentials, e.g., a SQLite database connection string for local testing: `sqlite:///./test.db`. However, sensitive credentials should never be directly in code, even as a default.
