The code is generally well-structured and follows good React Native practices for UI and state management. However, there is a critical functional and potential security issue related to calendar permissions.

**Key Issues:**

1.  **Calendar Permission Placeholder (Critical Functional/Security Gap):** The `requestCalendarPermission` function is explicitly marked as a 'Placeholder' and 'Simulates permission being granted'. This means the 'Sync with Native Calendar' feature is completely non-functional as-is. In a real application, this *must* be replaced with actual permission requests using a library like `react-native-permissions` or platform-specific APIs (`PermissionsAndroid` for Android, `EventKit` framework for iOS). Deploying this code without proper permission handling would lead to a broken feature or potential app crashes/unexpected behavior if the native APIs are called without permissions. From a security standpoint, relying on a simulated permission is a significant vulnerability if this were intended to bypass actual system checks.

2.  **Console Logging in Production:** The `console.log('Scheduling Workout:', scheduleDetails);` line is useful for debugging but should be removed or made conditional (`if (__DEV__)`) in a production build. Exposing application state or user data in logs can be a security risk, especially on rooted devices or if logs are accessible to unauthorized parties.

**Minor Improvements/Considerations:**

1.  **Accessibility:** While basic accessibility is present, consider adding `accessibilityRole` and `accessibilityLabel` to custom touchable components like `datePickerButton` and `scheduleButton` to improve the experience for users with screen readers.
2.  **Hardcoded Colors:** Using a centralized theme or color palette instead of hardcoded hex values (e.g., `#6200EE`, `#333`) would improve maintainability and consistency across the application.
3.  **Error Handling for Native Calendar Sync:** If the native calendar sync functionality were fully implemented, robust error handling for API calls (e.g., if adding an event fails) would be necessary beyond just `Alert` messages.

To approve this code, the `requestCalendarPermission` function needs to be fully implemented with actual native permission handling, and the console log should be removed or conditionalized.
