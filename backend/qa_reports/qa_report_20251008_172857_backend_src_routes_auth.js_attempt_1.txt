The code demonstrates good practices with modular routing, input validation using `express-validator`, and rate limiting for login attempts. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for enhanced security and robustness:

1.  **Weak Password Validation for Login:** For the `/login` route, `body('password', 'Password is required').exists()` only checks if the `password` field is present. It does not ensure that the password is not an empty string. It should be at least `body('password', 'Password is required').not().isEmpty()` to prevent an attacker from sending an empty password, which might lead to unexpected behavior depending on the authentication logic in the controller.
2.  **Rate Limiting for Other Routes:** While `loginLimiter` is correctly applied to `/login`, consider applying rate limiting to other public routes, particularly `/register` and `/refresh-token`.
    *   **`/register`:** Rate limiting can help prevent enumeration attacks (e.g., trying to guess valid email addresses by observing response times or error messages for already-registered emails) and mitigate spam registrations.
    *   **`/refresh-token`:** Although it requires a valid refresh token, an attacker could attempt to brute-force or guess refresh tokens if the endpoint is not rate-limited. A softer rate limit than login might be appropriate here.
    *   **`/social-login`:** Similar to `/register`, rate limiting can prevent spam or misuse of this endpoint.
3.  **Password Complexity for Registration:** While `isLength({ min: 6 })` is a good start, enforcing stronger password complexity requirements (e.g., requiring a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters) is generally recommended for better security. This would typically involve a custom validator or be handled in the `authController` before hashing.

Overall, the code provides a solid foundation, but addressing these points would further strengthen its security posture.
