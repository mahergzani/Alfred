The code is generally well-structured, functional, and follows good practices for React Native development, including accessibility. The calendar permission handling and event synchronization logic are implemented correctly. However, there are a few minor issues that need addressing:

1.  **Repeated Style Definition (Bug):** In the `StyleSheet.create` block, the `recurrenceButton` style is defined four times consecutively. This is likely a copy-paste error. Only the last definition will be applied, overriding any previous ones. This should be consolidated into a single `recurrenceButton` definition.

2.  **Invalid `last-child` Selector (Styling Bug):** The line `'recurrenceButton:last-child': { borderRightWidth: 0, }` is not valid in React Native's `StyleSheet.create`. React Native styles do not support CSS pseudo-classes like `:last-child`. To remove the right border from the last button, you'll need to apply conditional styling within the `map` function where the buttons are rendered.

    *   **Proposed Fix:** Modify the `map` function for recurrence options:
        ```javascript
        {['none', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly'].map((option, index, arr) => (
          <TouchableOpacity
            key={option}
            style={[
              styles.recurrenceButton,
              index === arr.length - 1 && styles.lastRecurrenceButton, // Apply specific style for the last item
              recurrence === option && styles.recurrenceButtonSelected,
            ]}
            onPress={() => setRecurrence(option)}
            accessibilityRole="radiobutton"
            accessibilityLabel={`Set recurrence to ${option}`}
            accessibilityState={{ checked: recurrence === option }}
          >
            <Text
              style={[
                styles.recurrenceButtonText,
                recurrence === option && styles.recurrenceButtonTextSelected,
              ]}
            >
              {option.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + option.slice(1)}
            </Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        ))}
        ```
        And add a new style `lastRecurrenceButton`:
        ```javascript
        lastRecurrenceButton: {
          borderRightWidth: 0,
        },
        ```

3.  **Redundant `disabled` Prop Condition (Minor Logic Issue):** The `disabled` prop for the `syncButton` is defined as `disabled={!hasCalendarPermission && Platform.OS !== 'ios' && Platform.OS !== 'android'}`. The condition `Platform.OS !== 'ios' && Platform.OS !== 'android'` will always evaluate to `false` in a React Native mobile application, as `Platform.OS` will invariably be either 'ios' or 'android'. This makes the overall condition equivalent to `disabled={!hasCalendarPermission && false}`, which means the button will *never* be disabled by this part of the condition. It should simply be `disabled={!hasCalendarPermission}` if the intent is to disable it only when permission is not granted.

4.  **Android `READ_CALENDAR` Permission (Minor Enhancement/Consideration):** For Android, you are requesting `PERMISSIONS.ANDROID.WRITE_CALENDAR`. While sufficient for *adding* events, many calendar integrations also request `PERMISSIONS.ANDROID.READ_CALENDAR`. If there's any future intent to read calendar events from the device, it might be beneficial to request both permissions together. For the current functionality (only adding events), `WRITE_CALENDAR` is sufficient.
