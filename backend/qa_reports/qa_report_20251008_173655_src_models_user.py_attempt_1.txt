The `User` model is generally well-structured and follows good practices for database modeling. However, there are a couple of security-related considerations:

1.  **`hashed_password` Column Length:** The `hashed_password` column is defined as `String(255)`. While this might be sufficient for some common hashing algorithms (like bcrypt, which typically outputs ~60-72 characters), it could be too restrictive for others, especially modern, stronger ones like Argon2id (which can generate hashes around 99 characters in its standard format). To ensure future compatibility and robustness against longer hash outputs, it's recommended to increase this length. A `String(256)` would be a minimal improvement, but `String(512)` or even using `sqlalchemy.Text` would provide more flexibility without significant overhead.

2.  **Hashing Best Practices (Application Layer):** While the model correctly designates a column for a `hashed_password`, it's crucial to emphasize that the *application code* responsible for populating this field must implement strong, secure password hashing. This means using a modern, salted, adaptive, and slow hashing algorithm such as **bcrypt**, **Argon2id**, or **scrypt**. Never store plain passwords, and avoid fast, unsalted, non-adaptive algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1/SHA-256 directly for passwords. The salt should be unique for each user and generated randomly.
