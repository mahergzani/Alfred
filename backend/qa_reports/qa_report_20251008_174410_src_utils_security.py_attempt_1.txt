The code demonstrates good practices for password hashing with bcrypt and JWT handling. Type hints are used, and basic input validation is present. However, there are a couple of critical security improvements needed, particularly regarding the `SECRET_KEY`.

**Issues Found & Recommendations:**

1.  **Critical: Insecure Default `JWT_SECRET_KEY` Handling:**
    *   **Issue:** The `SECRET_KEY` is initialized with a default, insecure value (`'your-super-secret-key-that-should-be-very-long-and-random'`) if `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is not set in the environment variables. While there's a `print` warning, relying on a print statement for such a critical security configuration is insufficient. An attacker could potentially guess or find this default key, compromising all JWTs.
    *   **Recommendation:** Remove the default value from `os.getenv`. Instead, load `SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("JWT_SECRET_KEY")` and then explicitly check if it's `None` or matches any known insecure default. If `None` or insecure, raise a `ValueError` or `RuntimeError` to prevent the application from starting in an insecure state. For instance:
        ```python
        SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("JWT_SECRET_KEY")
        INSECURE_DEFAULT_KEY = "your-super-secret-key-that-should-be-very-long-and-random"

        if not SECRET_KEY or SECRET_KEY == INSECURE_DEFAULT_KEY:
            error_msg = "CRITICAL: JWT_SECRET_KEY environment variable is not set or is using an insecure default value. This must be a long, random string. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION without setting a proper key!"
            # Use logging instead of print
            import logging
            logging.getLogger(__name__).critical(error_msg)
            raise ValueError(error_msg)
        ```

2.  **Logging vs. `print()` for Warnings/Errors:**
    *   **Issue:** The code uses `print()` statements for warnings (e.g., `SECRET_KEY` warning) and errors (`JWT token has expired.`, `Invalid JWT token.`). In production environments, `print()` statements are not ideal as they don't integrate with standard logging systems, making monitoring and debugging difficult.
    *   **Recommendation:** Replace `print()` calls with Python's built-in `logging` module. This allows for configurable log levels, output destinations (console, file, remote server), and better management of application events.

3.  **`datetime.utcnow()` vs. Timezone-Aware Datetime:**
    *   **Issue:** While `datetime.utcnow()` works, it's generally recommended to use timezone-aware datetimes explicitly set to UTC (e.g., `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` from `datetime` or `zoneinfo` in Python 3.9+). This reduces ambiguity and potential issues if system clocks are configured in non-UTC timezones or if the application needs to handle multiple timezones.
    *   **Recommendation:** Consider using `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` for creating JWT `exp` and `iat` claims for explicit timezone awareness.

Addressing these points will significantly enhance the security and maintainability of this utility.
