The configuration setup is generally well-structured and demonstrates good practices in using environment variables. However, there are a couple of critical security issues that need to be addressed, particularly concerning the handling of sensitive keys in production.

**Critical Security Issues:**

1.  **Insecure Default JWT_SECRET_KEY:** The `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in the base `Config` class has a hardcoded default value: `'your_super_secret_jwt_key_please_change_this_in_production'`. While there's a comment advising to change it, relying on such a default, especially if not overridden, is a severe security vulnerability. An attacker would know this default and could forge JWTs.

2.  **Disabled Production Key Validation:** The `ProductionConfig` class *correctly* includes commented-out code to raise a `ValueError` if `SECRET_KEY`, `OCR_API_KEY`, or `OCR_API_BASE_URL` are not set in the environment. This validation is *crucial* for ensuring that production deployments do not accidentally use insecure defaults or missing configurations. By leaving these checks commented out, a production environment that fails to set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable will fall back to the insecure hardcoded default from the base `Config` class, creating a critical vulnerability.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Remove Insecure Default Secret:** Modify the base `Config` class to remove the insecure default for `JWT_SECRET_KEY`. It should ideally be `JWT_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')` without a fallback, forcing the environment variable to be set for all environments that don't explicitly override it.

2.  **Enable Production Validation:** **Uncomment and enable the `ValueError` checks in `ProductionConfig`** for `SECRET_KEY`, `OCR_API_KEY`, and `OCR_API_BASE_URL`. This ensures that sensitive configurations are always explicitly provided via environment variables in production, preventing the use of insecure defaults.

3.  **Provide Secure Defaults for Development:** Since the base `Config` will no longer have a default for `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, uncomment and enable the `JWT_SECRET_KEY = 'dev_secret_key'` line within `DevelopmentConfig` to provide a clear, non-production-threatening default for local development.

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) Improvement (Future Consideration):** While the security headers section is commented out, it's good that it's present. If you ever enable CSP, prioritize removing `'unsafe-inline'` from `script-src` and `style-src` as it reintroduces Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) risks. The comment already highlights this, which is good awareness.

By addressing these points, the configuration will significantly improve its security posture for all environments, especially production.
