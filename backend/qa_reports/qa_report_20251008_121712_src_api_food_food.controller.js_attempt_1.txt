The code is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of security principles, especially regarding user ID handling and preventing basic unauthorized access. Error handling is also well implemented using `next(error)`.

However, there are a couple of areas where security and robustness can be further enhanced:

1.  **Comprehensive Input Validation:**
    *   **Pagination Parameters (`limit`, `offset`):** While `parseInt()` is used, it doesn't validate if the parsed values are non-negative or if `parseInt()` results in `NaN` (e.g., `limit=abc`). If `NaN` is passed to the service/database, it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. It's best to explicitly check for `isNaN` and ensure values are positive integers, potentially with a maximum allowed limit to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Request Body Validation (`createCustomFood`, `updateCustomFood`):** The basic `if (!foodData.name || ...)` check is a good start, but more robust validation is recommended. Using a dedicated validation middleware (e.g., `express-validator`, Joi, Yup) would allow for stricter schema validation, including data types, minimum/maximum values, string formats, etc. This improves data integrity and prevents malformed data from reaching the service layer.

2.  **Stronger Mass Assignment Protection (`updateCustomFood`):**
    *   The `if (updateData.userId) { delete updateData.userId; }` is a good attempt to prevent users from changing ownership. However, this is a blacklist approach and might miss other sensitive fields a user shouldn't modify (e.g., `isAdmin`, `isApproved`, `createdAt`). A more secure practice is to use a whitelist approach, where you explicitly define and pick only the fields from `req.body` that are allowed to be updated. For example, `const allowedUpdates = { name: req.body.name, calories: req.body.calories, ... };` or using an object utility like Lodash's `pick`.

These improvements would make the controller more robust against invalid input and potential malicious attempts to alter unintended data.
