The migration script is largely well-structured and follows good practices for creating tables, indexes, and triggers. However, there's a minor but important issue in the `DOWN` migration section regarding the order of dropping database objects. When dropping dependent objects, it's best to drop them in reverse order of their dependency to ensure a clean and predictable rollback.

**Issue Found:**

1.  **Incorrect Order of Dropping Objects in `DOWN` Migration:**
    The current `DOWN` migration drops the table first, then the trigger, and then the function. When a table is dropped, its associated triggers are usually implicitly dropped by the database system. This means the subsequent `DROP TRIGGER` statement might be redundant (though `IF EXISTS` handles this gracefully). More importantly, the function `update_updated_at_column()` is still referenced by the trigger. While the trigger on `OCRScan` is dropped (either implicitly or explicitly), it's best practice to drop the trigger *before* the function it calls, and both *before* the table they are associated with. This ensures that no dependencies are left dangling or cause unexpected behavior if the function were used by other triggers not explicitly dropped here.

    **Current `DOWN` Order:**
    ```sql
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "OCRScan";
    DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_ocrscan_updated_at ON "OCRScan";
    DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_updated_at_column();
    ```

    **Recommended `DOWN` Order:**
    ```sql
    DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_ocrscan_updated_at ON "OCRScan";
    DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS update_updated_at_column();
    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS "OCRScan";
    ```

**Recommendation for Improvement (Minor):**

1.  **`scan_status` Data Type:** While `TEXT` with a `DEFAULT` value works, for strictly defined status states (e.g., 'PENDING', 'PROCESSING', 'COMPLETED', 'FAILED'), consider using an `ENUM` type in PostgreSQL. An `ENUM` provides stronger data integrity by restricting values to a predefined list, which can prevent invalid status entries and make queries more efficient. If the statuses are likely to change frequently or be very numerous, `TEXT` is still acceptable, but for a fixed set, `ENUM` is often preferred.

Overall, the code is solid, and addressing the `DOWN` migration order will make it robust for rollbacks.
