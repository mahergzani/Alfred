      "description": "Hardcoded JWT secret found in the source code. This secret is used to sign authentication tokens.",
      "impact": "An attacker with access to the source code can forge valid authentication tokens, gaining unauthorized access to any user's account and protected resources.",
      "remediation_plan": "Remove the hardcoded secret from the source code. Store the JWT secret in a secure environment variable or a secret management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault). Access it at runtime using `process.env.JWT_SECRET`."

      "description": "Dependency 'express' is outdated (version 4.17.1). This version is vulnerable to multiple known security issues, including potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Denial of Service (DoS).",
      "impact": "Exploitation could lead to session hijacking, defacement of the application, or making the application unavailable to legitimate users.",
      "remediation_plan": "Update the 'express' package to the latest stable version. Run 'npm update express' or 'yarn upgrade express' and verify that the application functions correctly after the update. Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like 'npm audit' or Snyk."

      "description": "User profile endpoint reveals excessive information in error messages, including internal stack traces and database schema details when a query fails.",
      "impact": "Information leakage can provide attackers with valuable insights into the application's architecture, database structure, and potential weaknesses, aiding in the development of more targeted attacks.",
      "remediation_plan": "Implement a global error handler that catches all exceptions. Return a generic, non-descriptive error message to the user (e.g., 'An internal server error occurred'). Log the detailed error, including the stack trace, to a secure, internal logging system for debugging purposes."
